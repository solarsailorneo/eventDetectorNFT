# NFT Transfer Detection
A front-end that prints transfer transactions by means of an input box where you can specify any contract. I used the [WAGMI library](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) as a baseline.

## How to Use
Type the contract you want to track on the input box and click listen. When transfers happen, you should see a transfer tag an abbreviation of both the `from` and `to` wallets.
